> # CommandPlus
This is a plugin for you to send command to online/group players in one command only.  
Example: /commandplus send all economy give %player% 5000  
economy give %player% 5000 is the original command.  
This mean send all online players $5000.  
(Or you may understand it as sending /economy give <player> 5000 to all online players)
